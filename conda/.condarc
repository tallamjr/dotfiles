# This is a sample .condarc file.
# It adds the r Anaconda.org channel and enables
# the show_channel_urls option.

# channel locations. These override conda defaults, i.e., conda will
# search *only* the channels listed here, in the order given.
# Use "defaults" to automatically include all default channels.
# Non-url channels will be interpreted as Anaconda.org usernames
# (this can be changed by modifying the channel_alias key; see below).
# The default is just 'defaults'.
channels:
  - conda-forge

# Show channel URLs when displaying what is going to be downloaded
# and in 'conda list'. The default is False.
